## Webpack

see https://webpack.github.io/docs/usage.html

Webpack is a module bundler for websites. What this means is that Webpack can take our code and assest, analyze which files depend on others and use that to turn the separate code files into one big bundle file. We can then include this bundle file with our website without having to worry about include orders etc.
